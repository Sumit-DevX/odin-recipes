# odin-recipes

A simple and delicious recipes website built using only HTML.

In this project, I practiced using ordered and unordered lists, working with links, and applying appropriate HTML semantic tags for better content structure.

The website features recipes for the following dishes:
1. The Best Baked Ziti
2. Pickle Grilled Cheese
3. Zucchini Tots
